## What's Kishotenketsu

>Kishōtenketsu (起承転結?) describes the structure and development of classic Chinese, Korean and Japanese narratives.
It was originally used in Chinese poetry as a four-line composition, such as Qijue, and is also referred to as kishōtengō (起承転合?).
The first Chinese character refers to the introduction or kiku (起句?), the next: development, shōku (承句?), the third: twist, tenku (転句?), and the last character indicates conclusion or kekku (結句?).
句 is the phrase (句 ku?), and gō (合?) means "meeting point of 起 and 転" for conclusion.
Introduction (ki): Topic toss or introduction, what characters appear, era, and other important information for understanding the setting of the story.
Development (shō): Receives or follows on from the introduction and leads to the twist in the story. Major changes do not occur.
Twist (ten): Turn or twist to another, new or unknown topic. This is the crux of the story, which is also referred to as the yama (ヤマ?) or climax. It has the biggest twist in the story.
Conclusion (ketsu): Resultant, also referred to as the ochi (落ち?) or ending, it wraps up the story by bringing it to its conclusion.
